Such signatures are compatible with standard Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) digital signatures and can be processed with unmodified verifiers, which need not be aware of the procedure described therein. Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic security features associated with digital signatures but can be more easily implemented in various environments, since they do not need access to a source of high-quality randomness.},

abstract="We describe efficient techniques for three (or more) parties to jointly generate an RSA key. At the end of the protocol an RSA modulus N = pq is publicly known.

abstract="The problem of generating an RSA composite in a distributed manner without leaking its factorization is particularly challenging and useful in many cryptographic protocols. Our first contribution is the first non-generic fully simulatable protocol for distributively generating an RSA composite with security against malicious behavior in the two party setting. Our second contribution is a complete Paillier [37] threshold encryption scheme in the two-party setting with security against malicious behavior. Our RSA key generation is comprised of the following: (i) a distributed protocol for generation of an RSA composite, and (ii) a biprimality test for verifying the validity of the generated composite. Our Paillier threshold encryption scheme uses the RSA composite as public key and is comprised of: (i) a distributed generation of the corresponding secret-key shares and, (ii) a distributed decryption protocol for decrypting according to Paillier.",

title="Trapdooring Discrete Logarithms on Elliptic Curves over Rings",
booktitle="Advances in Cryptology --- ASIACRYPT 2000",

publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="573--584",
abstract="This paper introduces three new probabilistic encryption schemes using elliptic curves over rings. The cryptosystems are based on three specific trapdoor mechanisms allowing the recipient to recover discrete logarithms on different types of curves. The first scheme is an embodiment of Naccache and Stern's cryptosystem and realizes a discrete log encryption as originally wanted in [23] by Vanstone and Zuccherato. Our second scheme provides an elliptic curve version of Okamoto and Uchiyama's probabilistic encryption, thus answering a question left open in [10] by the same authors. Finally, we introduce a Paillier-like encryption scheme based on the use of twists of anomalous curves. Our contributions provide probabilistic, homomorphic and semantically secure cryptosystems that concretize all previous research works on discrete log encryption in the elliptic curve setting.",
