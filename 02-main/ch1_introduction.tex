Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that allows users to pay for
things electronically. Thousands of other cryptocurrencies exist, but only some
of them are really interesting from a political, economical or technical point
of view. Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous software developer going by the
name of Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, as an electronic payment system based on
mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of
any central authority and censorship-resistant, which could be transferred
electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. The blockchain is the
output of this secure, verifiable and immutable mathematical proof.

The most significant challenge in Bitcoin for the coming years is scalability.
Currently, Bitcoin enforces a block-size limit which is equivalent to only a few
transactions per second on the network. This amount is not sufficient in
comparison to large payment infrastructures, which allow tens of thousands of
transactions per second and even more at peak times such as Christmas.  To
address this there are some proposals to modify the transaction structure (SegWit \cite{SegWitBIP}),
some to modify the block-size limit (SegWit2x) and others to
create a second layer on top of the Bitcoin protocol (Lightning Network \cite{poon2016bitcoin}).
In the same idea of a second layer, this thesis explores the
implementation of a unidirectional payment channel for retail commercial
transactions that allows two parties to
transact with cryptocurrencies while minimizing the number of transactions needed
on the blockchain in a secure and trustless way. Every type of payment channel needs
multi-signature addresses to secure the funds. A cryptographic threshold scheme
might improve these schemes significantly. Finding such a threshold scheme that
fulfills the requirements is not trivial. The threshold scheme selected for this work is
adapted to the needs of channels, and is implemented in the Bitcoin cryptographic
library to compute a particular two-party threshold ECDSA signature.
