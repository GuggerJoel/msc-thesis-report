\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

Basic mechanisms of Bitcoin have been explained to introduce two significant
issues in Bitcoin today, i.e., the scalability problem and the latency problem.
These problems already have existing drafted solutions like consensus changes or
payment channels. Payment channels are not new to Bitcoin, multiple
implementations of the Lightning Network specification already exist. Another
scheme, with different capabilities, is proposed to handle a specific context
explained in the white paper. This system can be improved with threshold
cryptography by reducing the size of the transactions. This reduction is made by
replacing the multi-signature script in Bitcoin by a single signature computed
with threshold cryptography. The threshold scheme is analyzed and adapted to
\gls{ecdsa} before being implemented in the existing library used in
Bitcoin-core, the library \texttt{secp256k1}. Finally, further
research about payment channels, Bitcoin, and threshold signature schemes are
exposed.

The Bitcoin payment channel implementation will be released as open source software soon,
and testing will begin in the coming months. The threshold implementation will be
part of a current project comprising the creation of a free BTM machine using
payment channels to withdraw cash and threshold signature to buy crypto-coins to
avoid storing full private keys on the device.
