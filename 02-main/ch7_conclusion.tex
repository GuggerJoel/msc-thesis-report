Basics mechanisms of Bitcoin have been explain to introduce two major issues in
Bitcoin today, i.e. the scalability problem and the latency problem.
These issues already have existing drafted solutions like consensus changes or
payment channel. Payment channels are not new to Bitcoin and multiple implementations
of the Lightning Network specification already exist. A other scheme, with different
capabilities, is proposed to handle a specific context explain in the white paper.
This scheme can be improve with threshold cryptography by reducing the size of
the transactions. This reduction is done by replacing the multi-signature script
in Bitcoin by a single signature computed with threshold cryptography. The
threshold scheme is analysed and adapted to \gls{ecdsa} before been implemented
inside the existing library used in Bitcoin-core implementation, the library
\texttt{secp256k1}. Finally, further research about payment channels, Bitcoin,
and threshold signature scheme are exposed.

The Bitcoin payment channel implementation will be released in open source soon
and testing will begin in the next months. The threshold implementation will be
part of a current project comprising the creation of a open BTM machine using
payment channel to withdraw cash money and threshold signature to buy crypto-coins
to avoid storing full private keys on the machine.
