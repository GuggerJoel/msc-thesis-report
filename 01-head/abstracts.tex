Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that allows users to pay for
things electronically. Created by a pseudonymous software developer going by the
name of Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, as an electronic payment system based on
mathematical proof, Bitcoin can currently handle only some transactions per
second on the network. Thus, the most substantial challenge for the coming years
is scalability. This amount is not sufficient in comparison to big payment
infrastructures, which allows tens of thousands of transactions per second. As a
potential scalability solution, the idea of payment channels was suggested by
Satoshi in an email to Mike Hearn. The paper present, analyze and optimize with
threshold cryptography a unidirectional payment channel specific for retail,
commercial transactions scenario. The threshold scheme selected is adapted and
implemented into the Bitcoin cryptographic library to compute a particular
two-party threshold ECDSA signature.
