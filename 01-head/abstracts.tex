Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that allow users to to pay for
things electronically. Bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous software developer going by the name of
Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, as an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof.
Yet, the largest challenge in Bitcoin for the coming years is scalability.
Currently, Bitcoin can handle only some transactions per second on the network.
This is not sufficient in comparison to big payment infrastructures, which allows tens of
thousands of transactions per second. To allow scalability, payment channel has born some years ago.
A one-way payment channel specific for a retail commercial transactions scenario is presented, analyzed and optimized with
threshold cryptography. The threshold scheme selected has been adapted and implemented
into the Bitcon cryptographic library to compute a special two-party threshold ECDSA signature.
